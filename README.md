<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
This project is called Colgate Surveys, and it was done by Jude Ramanan, Fausto De Leon, Hugo Stickney, and Alex Radovich for Colgate's Gate-Hacks, 2024!

<h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
During our time at Colgate, a big problem we noticed is the divide between the adminsitration and student body. This project aims to fix that. It provides a simple user interface for faculty and students to make and answer polls which improves communication and community engagment. 

<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
There are two different sides to this website. On the client side, which the students will use, they can select an active poll, fill out the information, and submit it to the database. On the admin's end, they can create new polls, monitor existing ones, and delete old ones. When a poll is deleted, a random email is shown so the admin can contact that student regarding a prize.

<h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1>
This app was developed with Next.JS, a React Framework and TailwindCSS with a custom built API to handel calls and updates to our MongoDB database, which has been connected using Prisma. It is then hosted on our computer using Ngronk for everyone to see.

<h1>HOW TO USE</h1>
To use this site is easy. Simply click https://tinyurl.com/CUGHSY. To use the admin page, enter "admin" for the username and password.

<h1>DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLANGES</h1>
For many of us, this was our first hackathon, and the first time we touched databases, full stack development, HTTP servers, and frameworks. There was deffinently a big learning curve, especially with connecting the databases and creating the custom HTTP server, but once we overcame the inital obstacles and syntax shock, it was pretty intuitive how everything worked together. 

<h1>MARKET STRATEGY</h1>
Our approach to selling this app is pretty simple, just going to the Colgate administration with the product. Given more time, we would like to improve the UI and make it look even more visually pleasing and smooth. In addition, we can expand the site to account for multiple institutions, not just Colgate, so other companies, universities, and clients in general can create easily acsessible polls. We would also like to add more security features and advanced authentication/validation. Finally, we would like to host it on a more stable platform.
