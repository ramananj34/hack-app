<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
This project is called Colgate Surveys, and it was done by Jude Ramanan, Fausto De Leon, Hugo Stickney, and Alex Radovich for Colgate's Gate-Hacks, 2024!

<h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
During our time at Colgate, a big problem we have noticed is the divide between the adminsitration and the student body. This web-app aims to fix that. It provides a simple userface for faculty and students to make and answer polls and improve communication and community engagment. 

<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
There are two different sides to this website. On the client side, which the students will use, they can select an active poll, fill out the information, and submit it to the database. On the admin's end, they can create new polls, monitor existing ones, and delete old ones. When a poll is deleted, a random email is also given, and that student can be contacted to recieve a prize. 

<h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1>
This app was developed with Next.JS, a React Framework and TailwindCSS with a custom built API to handel calls and updates to our MongoDB database, which has been connected using Prisma. It is then hosted on our computer using Ngronk.

<h1>HOW TO USE</h1>

<h1>DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLANGES</h1>
For many of us, this was our first hackathon, and the first time we touched databases, full stack development, HTTP servers, and frameworks. There was deffinently a big learning curve, especially with connecting the databases and creating the custom HTTP server, but once we overcame the inital obstacle of figuring out what different things meant and troubleshooting, it was very easy to understand what was going on.

<h1>MARKET STRATEGY</h1>
Our approach to selling this app is pretty simple, just approaching the Colgate administration with the product. Given more time, we would like to improve the UI and make it look even more visually pleasing and smooth. In addition, we can expand the site to account for multiple institutions, not just Colgate, so other companies, universities, and clients in general can create easily acsessible polls. We would also like to add more security features and advanced authentication/validation.
